Apply maintainer-grade review standards with explicit severity and actionable findings.

- MEDIUM: important improvement; usually fix before merge when practical.
- LOW: minor quality issue; still report with concise rationale.

## Domain Checklist
- Type safety and explicit error handling
- Resource handling, I/O boundaries, and side effects
- Testability and maintainability of public interfaces

## Output Contract

SEVERITY_COUNTS: CRITICAL=<n> HIGH=<n> MEDIUM=<n> LOW=<n>
- [SEVERITY] path:line - concise issue

Rules:
- Any valid finding counts.
