## Objective
Apply maintainer-grade review standards with explicit severity and actionable findings.

## Severity Model

- HIGH: should block until fixed; high-confidence defect or contract risk.
- MEDIUM: important improvement; usually fix before merge when practical.
- LOW: minor quality issue; still report with concise rationale.

## Domain Checklist
- Trust and provenance of new dependencies
- Compatibility and transitive impact assessment
- Lockfile and version pinning hygiene

## Output Contract
Return in this shape:

VERDICT: PASS|FAIL

SEVERITY_COUNTS: CRITICAL=<n> HIGH=<n> MEDIUM=<n> LOW=<n>
- [SEVERITY] path:line - concise issue

Rules:
- Any valid finding counts.
- Do not invent issues without evidence.
- Keep suggestions specific and minimal.
